OOP Assignment 2

This is a repository for our OOP Assignment 2.

The question was:
Test has 4 data members namely, dm1,dm2, dm3, dm4 of different data types.
dm1 belongs to Date class, you can choose any data type for other data members.
dm1 is a static data member and is only changed by calling a function dm1Modify().
Initial value of dm1 is set to your birthdate.
dm1Modify() always shifts the date to next date.
dm1Modify() is called every time a constructor or destructor is called for the class.
Create appropriate set and get methods for each data member.
Using the concepts studied in course, enforce the constraint on functions that are not supposed to change data members must not do so even by mistake.
